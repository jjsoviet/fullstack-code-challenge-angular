# HappyCo Fullstack Developer Challenge

Using the information provided in this repository, build a simple web application that calls a weather API and displays the results based on the design provided.

## Overview

- **Timebox this challenge to 1-2 hours**. If you do not complete the challenge within those hours, please submit what you have completed. We will review your submission and discuss your approach during the interview.

- **You may use any framework or library you wish**, but please do not use a pre-built weather widget or component. We want to see how you build things from scratch.

## Requirements

- Use the [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs) to get the weather data.
- Match the designs. **Dark mode is not required, but nice to have.**
- Use the icons provided in `/icons/`.

## Nice to have

The following are not required, but are nice to have if you have time:

- Dark mode
- Geolocation
- Unit tests
- Responsive design
- Error handling
- Loading state

## Submission

- Submit your code as a public GitHub repository.
- Include a README with instructions on how to run your application.
- Include a list of any assumptions you made.
- Include a list of any improvements you would make if you had more time.

## Evaluation

We will evaluate your submission based on the following criteria:

- **Functionality**. Does the application work as expected? Does it meet the requirements outlined above?

- **Code quality**. Is the code well-organized and easy to follow? Are there any obvious bugs?

- **Creativity**. Did you go above and beyond the requirements? Did you add any additional functionality or polish to the application?

- **Design**. Does the application match the designs provided? Are there any obvious design flaws?

## Questions?

Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions you may have. Good luck!

## Internal Team Notes

Can you please take up to 2 hours to build this challenge.

Please take 5-10 minutes to record a loom video providing your feedback.

Questions we'd like answers:

- Is this too much work for a 1-2 hour challenge?
- Is the challenge too difficult?
- What languagues/framework/libraries did you use to build this?
- What was your favorite part of the challenge?
- What issues did you run into?
- Trade offs in technical solutions? What was the easy way and not-so-easy way? What decisions did you make?
- Do you feel that this project allows candidates to extend the project (to showcase skillset) to add other features? A searchbox for example? A GPS autodetect?
